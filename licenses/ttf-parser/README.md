A high-level, safe, zero-allocation TrueType font parser.

Can be used as Rust and as C library.

### Features

- A high-level API, for people who doesn't know how TrueType works internally.
  Basically, no direct access to font tables.
- A [C API](./c-api).
- Zero heap allocations.
- Zero unsafe.
- Zero dependencies.
- `no_std`/WASM compatible.
- Fast. See the *Performance* section.
- Stateless. No mutable parsing methods.
- Simple and maintainable code (no magic numbers).

### Safety

- The library must not panic. Any panic considered as a critical bug and should be reported.
- The library forbids the unsafe code.
- No heap allocations, so crash due to OOM is not possible.
- All recursive methods have a depth limit.
- Technically, should use less than 64KiB of stack in the worst case scenario.
- Most of arithmetic operations are checked.
- Most of numeric casts are checked.

### Alternatives

It's very hard to compare different libraries, so we are using table-based comparison.
There are roughly three types of TrueType tables:

- A table with a list of properties (like `head`, `OS/2`, etc.).<br/>
  If a library tries to parse it at all then we mark it as supported.
- A table that contains a single type of data (`glyf`, `CFF` (kinda), `hmtx`, etc.).<br/>
  Can only be supported or not.
- A table that contains multiple subtables (`cmap`, `kern`, `GPOS`, etc.).<br/>
  Can be partially supported and we note which subtables are actually supported.

Legend:

- ✓ - supported
- ~ - partial
- *nothing* - not supported

Notes:

1. While `ttf-parser` doesn't support rendering by itself,
   there are mutliple rendering libraries on top of it:
   [rusttype](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/rusttype),
   [ab-glyph](https://github.com/alexheretic/ab-glyph)
   and [fontdue](https://github.com/mooman219/fontdue).
2. Matching points are not supported.
3. When using from Rust, the library binary overhead depends on used methods
   and can vary from 10KiB up to 100KiB.<br/>
   When using from C, we have to include the Rust's std too, which blows up the size.
4. Depends on build flags.

### Performance

TrueType fonts designed for fast querying, so most of the methods are very fast.
The main exception is glyph outlining. Glyphs can be stored using two different methods:
using [Glyph Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/glyf) format
and [Compact Font Format](http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5176.CFF.pdf) (pdf).
The first one is fairly simple which makes it faster to process.
The second one is basically a tiny language with a stack-based VM, which makes it way harder to process.

The [benchmark](./benches/outline/) tests how long it takes to outline all glyphs in the font.

| Table/Library | ttf-parser     | FreeType   | stb_truetype   |
| ------------- | -------------: | ---------: | -------------: |
| `glyf`        |   `0.835 ms`   | `1.194 ms` | **`0.695 ms`** |
| `gvar`        | **`3.158 ms`** | `3.594 ms` |              - |
| `CFF`         | **`1.114 ms`** | `5.946 ms` |   `2.862 ms`   |
| `CFF2`        | **`1.763 ms`** | `7.001 ms` |              - |

**Note:** FreeType is surprisingly slow, so I'm worried that I've messed something up.
