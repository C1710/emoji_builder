The directories are named just like the crates with their respective version.
The folder structure has been preserved (if possible).
However, some authors did not specify any license file and copyright notice.
In these cases the license file has been added according to the Cargo.toml-file with an additional file containing the authors names and e-mail addresses (also according to the Cargo.toml-file)

If there is more than one license provided for one crate, the license has been chosen as follows
