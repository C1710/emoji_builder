## Third party code
This project uses many different crates. Their licenses can be found in the `licenses` folder.  
For more information, there's a `README.txt` included.  
However, only licenses for dependencies are included that are neither `dev-`, nor `build-`dependencies.  
Anyway, the whole source code of the dependencies is available online and also locally once `cargo build` is called.
